# smtpforme

Creates a local smtp server that can receive emails. Received emails are displayed in a web-based GUI via a self hosted web service.

This is mainly (only?) useful for debugging an application that sends emails, so that actual emails are not sent.

The application runs in the system tray. Clicking the icon will open a small window where you can open the web interface or quit.
